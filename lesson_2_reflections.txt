* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized a .git folder is created in the file system. This directory contains the meta data to keep track of the version history. However, any files present in the directory still remain untracked. Specific git add command must be executed to start tracking them.

We initialize the repository to maintain version history of the files under that project.


* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
While working on a project we would like to commit only some of the files together. Git provides functinality to do just the same. It allows to add files to an intermediate staging area using git add command. Once all the necessary files are in staging area we can perform commit on these files.
Working directory is the location in filesystem where all the files are present locally.


* How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Git allows us to add the files that are modified into the staging area. The commit command picks up the files from staging area to commit and not from the working directory. This allows to commit only the logical change even when there are multiple file changes. Also, git diff works on staging area and working directiry while git diff --staged works between staging area and the previous commmit.


* What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
With branches we can organize specific changes that apply to the entire project organized. It might an version for specific target group. Or it might be different modes of a game. Branches allow to organize these global changes separately.


* How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The branch structure is like a tree. There could be many branches that exist. Hence a graphical structure of the branch structure is more intuitive that specifying which branch belongs where. Use the command git log --graph [--oneline] to display the graphical branch structure.

* What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
While merging two branches the changes in one branch is merged into the currently checkout branch. Once this is completed the merged branch is deleted. This can be done because the commits in the merged brached can be acheived by using the current branch. The command to do this is git merge.


* What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Automatic merging is the best way if the changes are in different locations on the merging branches. However, if there is a conflict, then automatic merging cannot decide which changes to retain. It is better to leave this decision to the programmers concerned and manual merging is the best option.
